            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015)
            was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the
            11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
            engineering.<span id="dots">...</span
            ><span id="more"
              >He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science
              administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
              Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
              and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme
              and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known
              as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
              ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a
              pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
              Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
              nuclear test by India in 1974. Kalam was elected as the 11th
              president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
              Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National
              Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he
              returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public
              service after a single term. He was a recipient of several
              prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
              civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the Indian
              Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
              apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands,
              including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral
              ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried
              with full state honours.</span
